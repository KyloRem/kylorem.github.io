<p align="center">
  Hi! I'm Rem Jaques. I'm a security engineer specializing in SIEM administration and analytics development. I've worked various roles in security, from IT audit to research and development. I'm a passionate person who questions things often, loves to tinker, and commits to learning. I'm also a hobbyist music engineer, producer, and lead singer for an alternative pop band. You can find me road biking otherwise.
